# Stock Analysis with VBA

### Purpose
The main objective of this project was to harness the power of VBA and use that to analyze a dataset of stock tickers from the green energy sector. It was hoped that organizing data and conducting basic analysis of its metrics would provide enough insight to allow the stakeholder to make an informed financial decision. Provided data came from twelve different stocks and their performance metrics from the years 2017 and 2018. The VBA script would attempt to collect info on total volume of trades, starting price, and ending price. These values could be used to determine how much attention this stock had as well as it's annual return. These results could then be compared over two consecutive years. Formatting was to be applied in order to highlight market trends with regards to these equities.

From a programming language standpoint, this exercise served to demonstrate the possible advantages (or disadvantafes) of refactoring code. After the initial successful scanning of market data, the program was tweaked in an effort to leave it more efficient, but yield the same raw output.
